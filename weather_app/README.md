# Weather iOS Application

This project focuses on expanding my iOS development skills with various essential concepts and features, building on the foundation I’ve been creating. Here is a breakdown of the key topics I covered and implemented in this app.

## Features and Concepts Learned

### 1. Dark Mode Support
- Implemented full support for dark mode, ensuring the UI adjusts dynamically to match the system appearance settings.

### 2. Vector Images
- Used vector images as assets for improved resolution and scalability across various device sizes.

### 3. UITextField
- Utilized `UITextField` to capture user input and process the data efficiently.

### 4. Delegate Pattern
- Applied the delegate pattern to establish communication between different classes and manage the input handling efficiently.

### 5. Protocols and Extensions
- Leveraged Swift protocols and extensions to promote code reusability and maintainability.

### 6. Guard Keyword
- Used the `guard` keyword for early exit conditions, enhancing code readability and safety.

### 7. Computed Properties
- Defined computed properties to calculate values dynamically and improve the app's performance.

### 8. Closures and Completion Handlers
- Integrated closures and completion handlers for better asynchronous code execution, especially for network requests.

### 9. URLSession
- Utilized `URLSession` to make HTTP requests, fetch data from APIs, and manage network tasks.

### 10. JSON Parsing
- Parsed JSON responses using Swift's native `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols, making the data handling process smooth and efficient.

### 11. Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)
- Employed Grand Central Dispatch to manage background tasks and ensure UI updates are executed on the main thread.

### 12. Core Location
- Used Core Location to retrieve the device's current location, leveraging GPS data for location-based features.

## Getting Started

To run the project, clone the repository and open it in Xcode. Ensure your development environment is set up for iOS development.

## Requirements

- Xcode 15 or later
- iOS 16.0 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run on a simulator or physical device.

## Usage

- **Dark Mode**: The app adapts to the system’s light or dark appearance settings.
- **User Input**: Type information using text fields, with input handling via the delegate pattern.
- **Networking**: Fetch data from web services and parse it into usable models.
- **Location Services**: Grant permissions to access GPS data for relevant features.

## Technologies Used

- **UIKit**
- **Core Location**
- **Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)**
- **URLSession for networking**
- **Encodable and Decodable protocols for JSON parsing**

## Future Improvements

- Additional features leveraging advanced Swift and iOS capabilities.
- Optimization and enhancements based on user feedback.
